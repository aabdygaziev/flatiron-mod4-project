WTI Oil Price Prediction, Time Series Analysis: SARIMA

Oil price prediction by using time series analysis. WTI is Texas based oil index that is used as benchmark for pil pricing.

This grade is described as light crude oil because of its relatively low density, and sweet because of its low sulfur content. It is the underlying commodity of New York Mercantile Exchange's oil futures contracts (wikipedia).

In this work, I used data collected from FRED data website.
